        Hopefully the scoreboard is pretty intuitive to use, but here's a little
        guidance just in case!

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Basics</h2>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white"
            >Basic Gameplay</strong
          >
          By default, you are configured for a five-game match, played to 11 points,
          and you are required to win by two. Just <strong
            class="font-bold text-white"
            >click the button for whichever player scored</strong
          > until one player wins. This will bring up the <strong
            class="font-bold text-white">win screen</strong
          >; just click the button to start the next game. Once one player wins
          three games, the match will end and you can start a new match. The
          game and match end screens will change the
          <span class="px-1 text-white bg-green-700 rounded"
            >background to green</span
          > and display a message about the winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white"
            >Keybinds</strong
          >
          If you don't have the luxury of a separate scorer, each player has a unique
          keybind that works just like the scoring buttons. You can use a <strong
            class="font-bold text-white"
            >wireless keyboard or presentation clicker</strong
          >
          for much faster scoring. you could keep a wireless presentation
          clicker nearby and keep score on a iPad on a nearby table. By default,
          it uses the <em class="italic text-white"
            >Left and Right Arrow Keys</em
          > for scoring and
          <em class="italic text-white">Tab</em> for making corrections. More on
          that below
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white"
            >Corrections</strong
          >
          In case you click the wrong button or push the wrong key, there is a quick
          way to make scoring corrections. Simply press the
          <strong class="font-mono font-bold text-white uppercase"
            >Correction</strong
          > button or bound key to enter correction mode. <em
            class="italic text-white"
            >Now the scoring buttons/keys will subtract a point instead of
            adding a point</em
          >. Then simply click the correction button/key to go back to normal
          game mode. Try not to mess up the final point since the game ends
          instantly. You can tell you're in setup mode because it will change
          the
          <span class="px-1 text-white bg-red-700 rounded"
            >background to red.</span
          >

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Customization</h2>
        <p>
          You can change a variety of settings about the scoreboard in game by
          clicking the <strong class="font-mono font-bold text-white uppercase"
            >Setup</strong
          > button at the bottom. Setup mode has a
          <span class="px-1 text-white bg-blue-700 rounded"
            >blue background.</span
          >
          Anything you set will be saved to your browser for the next time you use
          the scoreboard. You can click the <strong
            class="font-mono font-bold text-white uppercase">Reset</strong
          >
          button to go back to the defaults. Click the <strong
            class="font-mono font-bold text-white uppercase">Done</strong
          >
          button to go back to
          <span class="px-1 text-white bg-black rounded">game mode.</span> Your
          settings will save automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white"
            >Color Modes</strong
          >
          The scoreboard uses different background colors to help you understand what's happening:
          <span class="px-1 text-white bg-black rounded">Black background</span> for normal gameplay,
          <span class="px-1 text-white bg-blue-700 rounded">blue background</span> for setup mode,
          <span class="px-1 text-white bg-red-700 rounded">red background</span> for correction mode,
          and <span class="px-1 text-white bg-green-700 rounded">green background</span> when games end or matches complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white"
            >Player Names</strong
          >
          You can change the names displayed for each player. Just type the new names
          into the boxes on the setup page.
        </p>

          <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white"
            >Changing Keybinds</strong
          >
          The keybinds are set to what I think are reasonable defaults based on my
          setup, but yours may be different. Click the
          <strong class="font-mono font-bold text-white uppercase"
            >Record Key</strong
          >
          button under the keybind that you want to change, then press the key you
          want to bind. It should show up in the box above, showing that the key
          was successfully bound.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-lg font-bold text-white border-b-2 border-white"
            >Game/Match Settings</strong
          >
          Below the keybinding section, you can also change the
          <strong class="font-bold text-white">number of points</strong> required
          to win a game and the <strong class="font-bold text-white"
            >number of games</strong
          > in a match. Note that this is the maximum number of games, not the number
          of games required to win. If you set it to five, then one player must win
          three games. This number cannot be even as that would allow a tie.
