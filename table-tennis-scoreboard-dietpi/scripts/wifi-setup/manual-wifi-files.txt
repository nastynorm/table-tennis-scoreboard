MANUAL WiFi CONFIGURATION FOR DIETPI
====================================

If your Pi is not appearing on the network, follow these steps:

STEP 1: CREATE wpa_supplicant.conf FILE
=======================================
Create a new text file called "wpa_supplicant.conf" (no .txt extension)
Copy this content and replace YOUR_WIFI_NAME and YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD:

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=US

network={
    ssid="YOUR_WIFI_NAME"
    psk="YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}

EXAMPLE for 192.168.88.x network:
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=US

network={
    ssid="MyHomeWiFi"
    psk="MyWiFiPassword123"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}

STEP 2: CREATE ssh FILE
=======================
Create an empty file called "ssh" (no extension, no content)
- Right-click in folder → New → Text Document
- Rename to "ssh" (remove .txt extension)
- File should be 0 bytes

STEP 3: COPY TO SD CARD
=======================
Copy BOTH files to the ROOT of your SD card:
- wpa_supplicant.conf
- ssh

NOT in any folders - directly on the SD card!

STEP 4: TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST
==================================

Pi Still Not Visible? Check These:

□ Files are in SD card ROOT (not in folders)
□ File names are exact: "wpa_supplicant.conf" and "ssh"
□ No .txt extensions on files
□ WiFi name (SSID) is spelled correctly
□ WiFi password is correct
□ Your WiFi is 2.4GHz (Pi Zero W doesn't support 5GHz)
□ Waited at least 5 minutes after power on
□ Pi has power (red LED should be on)
□ SD card is properly inserted

STEP 5: FIND YOUR PI
====================

Method 1 - Router Admin Panel:
- Go to http://192.168.88.1 in browser
- Login to router
- Check "Connected Devices" or "DHCP Clients"
- Look for "DietPi", "raspberrypi", or new device

Method 2 - Phone App:
- Download "Fing" app
- Scan network
- Look for "Raspberry Pi Foundation" devices

Method 3 - Command Line (Windows):
- Open Command Prompt
- Try: ping 192.168.88.100
- Try: ping 192.168.88.101
- Continue up to 192.168.88.254

Method 4 - Network Scanner:
- Download "Advanced IP Scanner" (free)
- Scan 192.168.88.1-254 range
- Look for new devices

STEP 6: COMMON ISSUES
=====================

Issue: Pi boots but no WiFi connection
Solution: 
- Check WiFi credentials again
- Ensure 2.4GHz network
- Try moving Pi closer to router

Issue: Can't find Pi IP
Solution:
- Check router DHCP lease table
- Look for MAC address starting with B8:27:EB or DC:A6:32

Issue: SSH connection refused
Solution:
- Ensure "ssh" file exists on SD card
- Wait longer for first boot (can take 5+ minutes)

Issue: Wrong network range
Solution:
- If your router uses different range (192.168.1.x or 192.168.0.x)
- Check router IP: ipconfig (look for Default Gateway)

STEP 7: ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES
===============================

If still not working:

1. Try Ethernet cable temporarily:
   - Connect Pi to router with Ethernet
   - Find IP via router admin
   - SSH in and configure WiFi manually

2. Use different WiFi network:
   - Try phone hotspot
   - Use guest network if available

3. Check Pi hardware:
   - Try different SD card
   - Ensure Pi Zero W (not regular Pi Zero)

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
==================
- Red LED: Power (should stay on)
- Green LED: Activity (should blink during boot)
- First boot: 3-5 minutes
- WiFi connection: 1-2 minutes after boot
- SSH ready: 5-7 minutes total

Your Pi should get IP in range: 192.168.88.100-254
Default SSH: ssh dietpi@[IP] (password: dietpi)
